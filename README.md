# Collection of some homeworks and class projects from university.

## Bezier curve painter and Quad tree collision detection 
demos of both homeworks are available at https://irislapa.github.io/fri-vss/. \
Code implementations in `bezier-curve-painter` and `quad-tree-collision-detection`

## Recommendation system
For a data-mining class I had to implement a movie recomendation system that uses matrix factorization.
The code is available in the `recommender_system` folder. Ui is yet to be implemented

## Cuda histogram equalization
For a parallel computing class I had to implement a histogram equalization algorithm using cuda. 
We were given a sequential implementation for each step (histogram calculation, comulative distribution calculation and histogram equalization), and had to paralelize it.
The code and test experiment report are available in the `cuda_histogram_equalization` folder.
